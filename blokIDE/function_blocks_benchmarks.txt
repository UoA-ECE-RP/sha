List of the examples working in function blocks (BlokIDE)
To see a detailed description of these systems, please see benchmarks_description.docx
The code generation on blokIDE doesn't work properly for header inclusion, need to manually correct the path for global.h
To get the output, I manually made the c code writing in a csv file


The following examples are working (10/07/2015):

- Watertank
- Switchtank
